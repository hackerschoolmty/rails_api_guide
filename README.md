##A.P.I.

###Application Programming Interface

##Wait Wat?

#####Ok, that's not a good start.

An API is a service that offers a couple of functions or methods trought protocols in order to communicate with another system.


Do you remeber about SOAP?

# RESTful services

#####_"REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol for data communication. It revolves around resource where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods."_

###Client–server
_A uniform interface separates clients from servers. This means that clients are not concerned with data storage, which remains internal to each server._

###Stateless
_The client–server communication is further constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests.   ._

###Cacheable
_As on the World Wide Web, clients and intermediaries can cache responses._

###Layered system
_Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load balancing and by providing shared caches._

###HTTP Methods

######Commonly used HTTP methods in REST based architecture.

-__GET__ _Provides a read only access to a resource._

-__PUT__ _Used to create a new resource._

-__DELETE__ _Used to remove a resource._

-__POST__ _Used to update a existing resource or create a new resource._
